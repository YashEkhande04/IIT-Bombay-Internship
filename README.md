# 🧠 Internship Project @ FOSSEE, IIT Bombay – Custom IC Design 🛠️⚡

Welcome to my internship repository! 🌟  
This project is all about **designing, simulating, and testing custom CMOS-based ICs** using the open-source EDA tool **eSim** developed by [eSim FOSSEE, IIT Bombay](https://esim.fossee.in/).  

🔍 Here's what's inside:

- 🧩 **Custom Subcircuit Files** – Like the Amplifiers , internal structure of low power Gates, counter and many more circuits built from scratch.
- 🧪 **Testbench Circuits** – With clean square wave inputs to validate IC behavior.
- 📐 **Symbol Files** – For schematic-level integration in eSim GUI.
- 📊 **Simulation Files** – Ready-to-run `.cir` files for transient analysis using Ngspice.

🎯 Goal: To gain hands-on experience with transistor-level circuit design, and understand how custom ICs are created, simulated, and verified.

🛠 Tools Used: `eSim`, `Ngspice`.

📂 All files are organized by:
## TestBench Files- [Testbenchs](https://github.com/YashEkhande04/IIT-Bombay-Internship/blob/main/Test%20Circuit%20and%20Analysis.zip)
## Subcircuits- [Sub-Circuits](https://github.com/YashEkhande04/IIT-Bombay-Internship/blob/main/Working%20IC.zip)
